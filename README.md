MoonMart is my very first e‑commerce project, built entirely with HTML and CSS. It’s a single‑page prototype that demonstrates the design and layout of an online store, focusing on clean visuals and simple structure without backend or JavaScript functionality.

Overview
MoonMart was created as a beginner project to practice front‑end development.
It simulates an online shopping experience on a single page, showcasing products and store branding.

Features:
1. Single Page Layout: All content presented on one HTML page

2. Product Showcase: Items displayed with images, descriptions, and prices

3. Store Branding: Header and hero section introducing MoonMart

4. Navigation Bar: Links to sections within the same page (Home, Products, Cart, Contact)

5. CSS Styling: Clean and modern design with responsive elements

Lessons Learned:
This project helped me practice:

1. Building a single‑page layout with HTML

2. Styling product grids and sections with CSS

3. Organizing assets and documenting projects on GitHub
